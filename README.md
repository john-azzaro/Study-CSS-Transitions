## What is CSS Transitions Study?
The CSS Transitions Study examines the implementation of transitional effects to web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the buisness logic.  In this particular study, when the user scrolls down the page, the background will change colors as the second page reveals itself.

## Does CSS Transitions Study feature commentary?
Yes! I use extensive commentary (mostly in the form of my thought process) so that the new and curious can follow the logic in the program and get an idea of my reasoning behind each and every line of code.  In addition to my line-by-line commantary, I also provide a Process text file that gives a good outline of my implementation process.
